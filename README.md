# 🌐 ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics

Welcome to the official repository of the **ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics** — a visionary initiative dedicated to designing the framework for a bio-ecological, merit-based civilization grounded in empirical education, ethical governance, and real-time global planning.

## 📚 Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a **public archive** of documents, frameworks, and research materials developed by Joseph A. Sprute and collaborators. It supports the ERES mission to unify EarnedPath, GiantERP (GERP), and PlayNAC concepts into actionable models for a sustainable and equitable future.

Key goals:
- Provide open access to foundational documents and whitepapers
- Facilitate AI-supported metadata discovery and exploration
- Enable researchers, developers, and institutions to build upon ERES concepts

## 📁 Directory Structure

/Documents/ → Primary source documents (Markdown or PDF)
/Metadata/ → JSON or YAML metadata tags for each document
/README.md → Overview and navigation

## 🤖 AI Integration

This repository is **AI-compatible**. You may use tools like **ChatGPT** or custom AI apps to:
- Search documents by concept, tag, or author
- Extract summaries and metadata
- Explore semantic links across topics (e.g., GCF ↔ Vacationomics ↔ Paineology)

**Try this prompt in ChatGPT:**

> “Read the file `Civilization_II.md` from https://github.com/ERES-Institute-for-New-Age-Cybernetics and extract the key policies, proposed formulas, and institutional implications.”

We encourage developers to build integrations using OpenAI, Claude, or open-source LLMs.
